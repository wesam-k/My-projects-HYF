        <h2>Hiking</h2>
        <p class="just-first-paragraph">
          Hiking in Bavaria is as diverse as the landscape itself! The south is
          dominated by the majestic Alps whose hiking tracks and mountain trails
          guarantee breathtaking views. The many lakes in the pre-alpine
          landscape such as Tegernsee, Chiemsee, Starnberger See or Forggensee
          near Füssen wait to be explored and are ideal for a refreshing swim
          after an exhausting hike. The almost 3000 m high Zugspitze is a
          particularly exciting highlight for hiking enthusiasts. The castles of
          Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein near Füssen are also worth
          visiting.for example:

            high granite rocks and the Goldsteig winds through the middle as a
            narrow path. You get down quite quickly there and enjoy every step.”
            Long-distance hiking means finding your rhythm. Your pace may be a
            bit jolted on the first day, but an even hiking rhythm will soon set
            in. You will immerse yourself in the landscape and get a feeling for
            the special things in life. For example whilst seeing out the day’s
            hiking in an Upper Palatinate Zoigl pub, where locals still brew
            their own beer. You can listen to the conversations, marvel at the
            rustic ambience and enjoy the luxury of the simple hiking life. On
            the next day, the hike continues – always as far as you want.

            Starting from the parking lot you will take the forest road up,
            direction Reschbergwisen. In the middle of the nice meadow follow
            the sign to Enningalm towards the right. Crank up on the wide road
            all the way to its highest point. After a short descent turn right
            on the road, direction Enningalm (by the big information table of
            Bavarian Saatsforsten). Shift up to your highest gear and work your
            way up on the steep platform. After that, just in a couple of
            meters, follow the hiking path to Enningalm.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the good rides the fun begins now. From Enningalm thought the
            Hut area, ride in the direction Krottenköpfel (South). Turn right on
            the fork towards Linderhof. From there on you will find yourself on
            a funny, and easy to ride hiking path with many switchbacks turns,
            leading you to Rotmossalm. By the Rotmossalm stay left, and follow
            the path on the edge of the woods. On all the possible forks keep
            yourself right and after a steeper part, come a forest road turning
            to the left. After that, there is just a comfy path all the way to
            Garmisch where you can roll back to the parking lot in Burgrain.

          <strong>Zugspitze (2,962m):</strong> it's not just the highest point
          in Germany, but also a mystery that entices so many hikers, climbers
          and day-trippers. This is the Zugspitze. Remember though, to hike and
          climb mountains you must be very fit. But if you don't want to work
          that hard, you can combine climbing with a ride in the Zugspitzbahn
          cable car.

            Germany's highest mountain is located southwest of
            Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the Wetterstein mountain range. The 2,962
            meter (9,715 ft.) high summit forms the border between Germany and
            Austria. The first climb took place in 1820 and was commissioned by
            the "Royal Bavarian Topographic Bureau".<br />
            <strong>What you need to bring to the hike to Zugspitze:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Water (2 – 3 litres) for the first day</li>
            <li>Snacks and optional lunch for both days</li>
            <li>Blister plaster and emergency blanket and first aid kit</li>
            <li>Ear plugs and a sleeping mask for a good sleep</li>
            <li>thin sleeping bag</li>
            <li>Warm clothes in layers because it is cold on the peak</li>
            <li>scarf & hat for the peak</li>
            <li>Changing clothes for the next day and for the summit</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Routes to Zugspitze What you lack on the summit you may enjoy on
            your way up. There are two normal climbing routes, the south route
            from Reintal and the north-east route from Höllental (this latter
            means Hell valley).<br />
            in summer time it requires only a basic walking gear. There are two
            huts on that route, Reintalangerhutte (1.366 m), and Knorrhütte
            (2052 m).
          </p>
          <p>
            Far more attractive appears to be the Höllental route. You will
            start from Hammersbach, a village at around 750 meters above the
            sea. This route includes all you may wish to experience, walk
            through man-made tunnels, a long glacier walk, several lengthy
            ferratas, rock scramble, there may be icy areas along ferrata
            sections.<br />
            There is also a mountain hut Höllentalangerhutte (1379 m) on the way
            up, and most of the climbers spend a night there. You will have to
            pay an entrance fee (3 Euro in 2010) at the gate in Hoellentalklamm
            which is at around one hour walk from Hammersbach.

          Bavaria boasts more than 100 ski regions, world cup locations and
          spectacular pistes – from the Allgäu to the Berchtesgaden Region.<br />However,
          family skiing is a particular favourite in Bavaria, such as in
          Mitterfirmansreut, an idyllic village in the Bayerischer Wald
          (Bavarian Forest).

          40 kilometres of pistes, 4 valley descents and rustic ski huts
          guarantee lots of snowy fun for the whole family in
          Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Three ski mountains unite to form the
          Garmisch-Classic ski area: Hausberg, Kreuzeck and Alpspitze offer
          winter sports enthusiasts an extensive range of pistes – newcomers and
          professionals, skiers and snowboarders, youngsters and veterans –
          everyone finds their perfect descent here. From gentle to a 92%
          gradient, Garmisch-Partenkirchen has everything. 40 piste kilometres
          of all levels of difficulty make this a family-friendly ski area. And
          those looking for a serious challenge between the wide blue and red
          pistes can find what they want on the Kreuzeck. Free fall on the
          Kandahar<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          The local mountain with its range of gentle to moderate pistes, on the
          other hand, is ideal for children and inexperienced skiers and
          snowboarders, while the pistes below the Alpspitze vary in terms of
          difficulty, but are hugely impressive with their magnificent views and
          wonderful mountain panorama. As the Alpspitze lies above the tree
          line, there are uninterrupted views of the charming Alpine scenery.
        </p>
        <p>
          It counts as one of the most legendary descents in the Alps: the
          Kandahar descent. With one section at a gradient of 92% it is one of
          the steepest pistes in the world. The top skiers come down it as part
          of the Ski World Cup. Relaxed ski fun – for beginners too

          Clouds of smoke rise up out of a chimney on the edge of Leubach in the
          Rhön. They come from a cast-iron stove which heats a workshop that at
          first glance doesn’t look like anything special. After their day’s
          work is done, Andreas Weber and Alexander Hergenhan ply an unusual
          craft here: They build traditional sledges known as Davos sledges.
          “These are sledges with crescent-shaped runners, which have slats
          attached to their top ends”, explains Alexander Hergenhan. The
          31-year-old is a master joiner and the great-grandson of the founder
          of “Weber-Schlitten“. He has been involved in the manufacture since
          2013. Together with his uncle, Andreas Weber, who has been building
          Davos sledges as a sideline since 1980, in recent years he has
          breathed fresh life into the workshop, set up in 1924.
        </p>
        <p>
          They used to make the sledges out of beech but nowadays we use native
          ash”, says master joiner Weber. Why? Ash has longer fibres and
          therefore lasts longer than beech. Each sledge represents three hours’
          work, but it takes over three months from start to finish. “We start
          by boiling up the wood for the runners in a large cauldron to make it
          pliable”, says Andreas Weber, explaining a key stage in the process.
          We then use a bending machine to get it into the correct shape. After
          two or three months of drying time, both men mount the stands on the
          runners then add the seating slats. <br />The Davos sledge is a
          genuine classic on Bavaria’s toboggan runs, such as the one from
          Wallberg down to the town of Tegernsee. It is one of the most
          beautiful runs in the country. You slide through a snow-covered winter
          landscape for half an hour, breathe in the fresh air and enjoy the
          speed of the runners. Winter can be so beautiful.

          Just walking: That’s all some outdoor sportspeople want to do, even in
          winter.<br />In Bavaria, the Bayerischer Wald (Bavarian Forest) is the
          ideal destination. Numerous trails are cleared and rolled and there
          are specially marked winter walking trails. There’s even the allure of
          a mountain peak …

          Who wants to sledge in Upper Bavaria, which is on the Tegernsee gold
          right! Because here there is a whole row of toboggan runs, especially
          one of the longest natural toboggan runs in Germany on the Wallberg
          near Rottach-Egern. For a total of 6.5 kilometers - that's about half
          an hour - tobogganing fans can plunge downhill to enjoy themselves. So
          that everything goes right and no one ends up in the lurch, the train,
          which can be conquered by pedestrian or Wallberg train, is prepared
          and checked daily. If you do not have your own sledge, you can rent
          one at the valley station of the Wallbergbahn. Since the Wallberg
          route is not completely safe, wearing a helmet is also recommended for
          experienced drivers.
